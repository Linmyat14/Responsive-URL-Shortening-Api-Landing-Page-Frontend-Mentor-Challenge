# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API  Website Challenge

I completed this url shortening responsive website design using Bootstrap 5 and SASS for customized designs, colors and themes. I also use PurgeCSS in this project to remove unused css from bootstrap.css.

Feel free to review my codes and share your suggestions. Thank you. ðŸš€ðŸš€
